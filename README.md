### Why "Nura"?

The name *Nura* is derived from Arabic, meaning "light" or "illumination." It represents clarity, guidance, and a bright, fresh approach to digital experiences. This reflects my focus on building clean, intuitive interfaces with a strong visual identity.

### Why Angular?

I chose Angular as my main frontend framework because it allows for:
- Strong typing and maintainable code with TypeScript  
- Scalable architecture suitable for large projects  
- Powerful reactive programming with RxJS
